# MOS

This is a project involving the design and implementation of a multiprogramming operating system (MOS) for a hypothetical computer configuration that can be easily simulated (Shaw and Weiderman, 1971). The purpose is to consolidate and apply, in an almost realistic setting, some of the concepts and techniques discussed in this book. In particular, the MOS designer/implementer must deal directly with problems of input-output, interrupt handling, process synchronization, scheduling, main and auxiliary storage management, process and resource data structures, and systems organization.


There are 2 phases. Phase 1 & Phase 2

Phase 1 and Phase 2 both are written in C++.

There are no errors in Phase 1 while there are 7 errors in Phase 2.

Input file & Output file for Phase 1 is ipp1 & opp1 resp. While that for Phase 2 is input and output
